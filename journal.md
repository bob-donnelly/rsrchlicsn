# The right license

Each piece of software has a license even if it is not specified by the owner it is covered by copyright.

## MIT license 

Is a open license that freely gives permission to anyone to reuse the work related to the license. [https://choosealicense.com/](licenses/mit)

It includes being able to sell your work that built upon theirs as long as you include the permission given to you by the license holder as a citation.

I would choose this for work I do for my studies or my own work that does not involve proprietary or confidential information.

## Creative commons attribution sharealike ver 4.0 International license

Is a license to share and use the work of others as long as you update the community with the changes you made and allow them to use the updated work you have done in their work. In the sharealike spirit. It is a license that applies to non software and software alike. [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en_US](CC Sharalike) Like MIT but you need to update the originator with your addition where as in MIT you do not.

## Apache 2.0 License

This license preserves copyrights and the source code which is not required to be distributed unlike the Creative commons or others. [https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/] (Apache license) Good to use for work which the end user or you want to keep as confidential information.

## The Unlicense

Because if you provide software or work with no license it defaults to the person who made the product or other work there is a "unlicense" license.
Where instead of allowing any use it dedicates the work or software to the public domain where the "public" can use it for any reason whatsoever. [https://choosealicense.com/licenses/unlicense/](Unlicense and public domain)

This license is good for work that benefits all humanity or will improve the public domain for everyone.
